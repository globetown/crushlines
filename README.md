# crushlines

# What?
Check out who is checking you out 

# Why?
Our initial reason for building this app is to escape from daily responsibilities into imaginary, fun world, purely for our own sanity.

Our second reason is to entertain people on the dreaded commute to work.

Our third reason is to learn how to build native app and practise interesting features of this upcoming application.

# How?
We will use following technologies:
- Node
- Hapi
- React
- React Native
- Redux
- FlexBox
- Databases: Postgresql, Elasticsearch
- Testing: Tape or Mocha, Jasmine

# Wireframes
